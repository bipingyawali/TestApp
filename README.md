A small Laravel application that integrates with the GeoIP API at https://about.ip2c.org

This application should:

Display a form that accepts an IP, defaulting to the userâ€™s current IP
Validate the format of the IP
Query the API, handling success and failure states
Store the response in a database and display the information on screen
